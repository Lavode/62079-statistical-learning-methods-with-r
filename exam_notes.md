- One question 'programming with R'

## Example questions

- Given p value of x, do we discard or reject H0?
  - Usually as e.g output of student's t test -> interpret that one

- Given output of linear model, what can you say about model quality
  - Are all coefficients important?

- LDA vs linear regression:
  - When to use what
  - Numbers of parameters of each?
  - => Slides 06b, p 59

- LDA vs k-NN vs others
  - => Slides 06b, pp 66

- Curse of dimensionality
 - => Slides 09, p 17

- Use RNG seed for reproducible train/test split

- Given similarity matrix, find most similar pairs
  - Show merging path if e.g. applying single-link (max similarity) merging
  - => Slides 09, pp 42
